      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project explores the Hong Kong Extradition Protests that began on March 15, 2019, 
        against a proposed amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, allowing extradition to mainland China.</p>
      <p>It aims to provide a detailed analysis of the Protests, discovering their unique features and shows the connection among them. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="data">
      <h2>Data Overview</h2>
      <p>The project  relies on two main datasets: </p>
      <p><b>ACLED Dataset</b>: This dataset includes detailed records of protest events in Hong Kong from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2020.</p>
      <p><b>LOD Dataset</b>: This dataset provides additional context and data related to specific protest events in Hong Kong.</p>

      <h2>Visualizations</h2>
      <p>Since I need to compare events related to Extradition Protests to those are not, bar chart is a good choice to do it. 
        It is easy to see the different values of different categories.
      </p>
      <div class="chart">
          <img src="/Viz/bar_chart_comparison_types.png" alt="bar chart for compare types">
          <p><b>Description</b>: This bar chart compares the event types of two categories, we can see <u>Protests</u> are common in both related and non-related contexts, with 414 and 486. 
            In contrast, <u>Riots</u> are more frequent in events related to the movement, with 189 compared to just 25 in non-related events.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart">
        <img src="/Viz/bar_chart_comparison_sub_types.png" alt="bar chart for compare subtypes">
        <p><b>Description</b>: This bar chart compares the sub-event types of two categories, The most common sub-event type is <u>Peaceful protests</u>,  with 368 related to movement and 474 not related. 
          In contrast, <u>Violent Demonstation</u> has 189 events related to and only 25 not related. In <u>protests with intervention</u>, it occurs more frequently in related events, with 43 occurrences compared to 11 in non related events.
          <u>Excessive Force Against Protesters</u> are relatively rare.
        </p>
        <p class="result"><b>Result:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Events related to the movement tend to have a higher incidence of violent and intervention-related sub-events compared to those not related to the movement.</li>
            <li>The relatively higher number of protests with intervention in related events suggests a greater involvement of law enforcement in these contexts.</li>
            <li>While peaceful protests are common in both contexts, violent demonstrations and riots are more strongly associated with events related to the movement.</li>
          </ol>

        <p><b>Description</b>: This line chart provides a timeline of protests in Hong Kong, to distinguish between protests related to the movement and those are not.
        The x-axis is the date, from 2019 March to 2020 June</p>
        <p>From the chart, we can see the protests for both types have a low acount and have an increase around mid 2019. The protests activites related the movement increasing a lot from that period.
          The blue line reaches the highest peak around 2019 November, with more than 60 protests events.After that, the number of both types starts to decline but the orange line shows more consistent.
        </p>
        <p class="result"><b>Result:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>There is a significant impact of the movement during the late 2019 about the movement.</li>
            <li>Non related events are more consistent but less tense.</li>

        <p><b>Description</b>: This map represents the geographic distribution and concentration of protest events across various districts in Hong Kong. 
          Each district is shaded according to the number of protests, with a gradient color scale indicating the intensity from lighter to darker shades.</p>
        <p>The district of <u>Yau Tsim Mong</u> has the highest concentration of protests, making it the primary hotspot for protest activities in Hong Kong.
